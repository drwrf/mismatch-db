      Mismatch\DB - A simple library for complex SQL.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------~

      The goal of Mismatch\DB is to make building and executing SQL
      queries dead simple. It optimizes for the common scenarios, while
      still allowing you to fall back to straight SQL when necessary.

      You see, SQL is actually pretty good at its job and you shouldn't
      have to work around your ORM to get at it.

      Here's what you can expect.

        - Higher-order methods for finding records
        - Robust support for complex expressions
        - Transparent escaping of user input
        - Awesome type inference

      As a quick example, let's find ten active authors who recently signed
      up for our service, and let's order them by name.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------~

      use Mismatch\DB\Query;
      use Mismatch\DB\Expression as e;

      $authors = (new Query($conn, 'authors'))
        ->order('name', 'asc')
        ->where([
          'signup' => e\after('2014-04-01')
          'active' => true,
        ]);

      foreach ($authors as $author) {
        // It's pretty easy
      }
